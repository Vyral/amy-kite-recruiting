How can you ensure that people will attend your open houses? Here are a few of my tips.

When you hold an open house for a listing, it can be frustrating if no one shows up, right? So how can you be certain that people will actually attend your open house?

**First, you need to advertise it properly**. Putting signs in the yard is fantastic, but there’s more to marketing your open house than just that; you also need to **post the event online, hand out flyers, go door-knocking, and advertise it on social media**. Increasing the number of people who know about your open house is important; the people you reach may be interested themselves or they may know someone who is. I encourage you to add one or two items every time you do an open house—see what works for you\!

As always, if you have any questions about maximizing the outcome of your efforts as an agent, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to chat with you.
