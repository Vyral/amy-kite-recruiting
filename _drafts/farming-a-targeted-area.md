I want to share a short message about farming. **I started my business with farming**. I began with a 1,600 door neighborhood. That’s a ton of doors. Every month I hand-deliver a newsletter.

Farming is targeting your marketing to a certain area. When it comes to farming and targeting, I advise that you go small into an area you can manage. If you can only manage 100 doors, that’s fine, but you want to do it well. Do it right: Communicate with them regularly, get to know them, and create a relationship with these people. Think about what is manageable for you.

One thing you may want to do is stand on the corner and hand out KIND Bars. **There are many things you can do in your farm besides door-knocking, handing out newsletters, and sending postcards**. You can actually get to know people too.

If you have any questions about targeting, marketing, or farming, I’m here to help. Feel free to call or email me with your needs.
