<center><em>As a Realtor, you shouldn&rsquo;t forget to keep your safety a top priority when meeting with clients.</em></center>

<br>Realtor safety is a big topic nowadays. With that in mind, I have a question to ask you: **Have you thought about the best way to meet with clients?**

Are you meeting them at your office or a Starbucks, perhaps? Are you ensuring someone knows with whom you're meeting? Are you getting a driver's license or some form of identification before meeting with a person?

These are all things to consider when meeting someone for the first time—potentially even after that. Someone should always know where you are. It doesn’t hurt to have a buddy system. Do you have someone else joining you for each meeting? Most mortgage professionals would be happy to join you at an open house.

The bottom line is, **you need to make certain you’re safe**. Create a system or ask your office what their system is to ensure your safety. You might also consider keeping your spouse on the line during meetings. There are devices you can carry that will alert the police department and people you know if you’re in trouble.

Take your safety seriously—it’s a job, and you have a long life to live.

If you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
