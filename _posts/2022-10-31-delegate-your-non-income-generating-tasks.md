What are the dollar-productive tasks in your business? In a nutshell, these are the activities you’re paid the most amount of money to do. As a real estate agent, these can include going to appointments, establishing prices on properties, negotiating contracts, etc. Generally, these are the parts of your business that only *you* can do.&nbsp;

With that said, who does the other tasks in your business that aren’t generating income? If you’re doing them yourself, you’re only decreasing your average dollar per hour and not being productive with your time. What can you do to increase your revenue without doing these tasks yourself?

Here’s our secret: **We employ a lot of cyberbackers from the Philippines.** They leverage our businesses and teams and keep us competitive. Some of the tasks they have taken over include marketing, making phone calls, creating lists, handling the MLS, etc. This allows our team members to focus on the things that only *they* can do.&nbsp;

If you’re interested in gaining this leverage in your real estate business or have any other related questions, call or email me. I’ll be happy to connect with you\!
