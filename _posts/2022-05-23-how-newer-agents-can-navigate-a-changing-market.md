If you’re new to the real estate industry, you’ve probably enjoyed the last few years of record sales. Now, we're heading into a shifting market. Are you ready?

It’s time to get back to basics, and that’s why **I recommend you read “Shift: How Top Real Estate Agents Tackle Tough Times” by Gary Keller.** This book covers tactics and strategies you should consider in a shifting market. For example, marketing can be expensive. On the other hand, prospecting is much more practical in a tougher market.

**If all you do is sit back and hope you’ll make it through our changing market, you probably won’t.** This book covers plenty of practical tips to help you not only survive but thrive in a changing real estate environment.

My team is actually doing a book club on “Shift” right now. If you have questions about it or anything else related to the industry, I’d be happy to speak with you. Just call or email me.
