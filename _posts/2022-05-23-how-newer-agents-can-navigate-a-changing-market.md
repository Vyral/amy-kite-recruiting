If you’re new to the real estate industry, you’ve probably enjoyed the last few years of record sales. Now, we're heading into a shifting market. Are you ready?&nbsp;

It’s time to get back to basics, and that’s why **I recommend you read “Shift: How Top Real Estate Agents Tackle Tough Times” by Gary Keller.** This book covers tactics and strategies you should consider in a shifting market. For example, marketing can be expensive. On the other hand, prospecting is more practical in a tougher market.&nbsp;

**If all you do is sit back and hope you’ll make it through our changing market, you probably won’t.** This book covers plenty of practical tips to help you not only survive but thrive in a changing real estate environment.&nbsp;

My team is actually doing a book club on “Shift” right now. If you have questions about it or anything else, I’d be happy to speak with you. Just call or email me; I look forward to hearing from you\!
