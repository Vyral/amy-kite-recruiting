I love investing in real estate, and one of the things I love most about it is the B.R.R.R.R method. It stands for buy, rehab, rent, refinance, and repeat. Why is this method so great?

First, you buy a property, and you might have to put some money into it to rehab it. You’ll rent the home to someone at a higher rate, and refinance it later to get all your money back out. Finally, you repeat this process with all that freed-up money. You can just keep doing this over and over.

**Understand that property values rise by 4% on average every year.** If you bought a $100,000 property today, it would be worth around $140,000 in 10 years. On top of that, you can file depreciation because you're renting it out, claim other tax benefits, and have a stable source of cash flow. It’s a great way to invest your money.

If you’d like to learn more about the B.R.R.R.R. method, feel free to call or email me. If you’ve been doing it already, I’d love to hear your stories.
