Real estate agents frequently ask me when they should hire an assistant. I remember being in that position when I started in the real estate business, and there’s also a time after you’ve hired people that you realize you need to hire even more help. These days, it’s getting more and more difficult to find great people to work for you. Businesses are shutting down because they can’t find employees, so today I’m offering my advice.

When you’re considering hiring an assistant, **ask if there’s work not getting done** or if you’re working too many hours. Is someone at home feeling like they never see you or that all you ever do is work? That means it might be a good time to hire an assistant.&nbsp;

Also, think about if you’re missing out on opportunities or are tired of doing those unenjoyable tasks. Those are also perfect times to hire some help. Do not lose business because you don’t have help; that’s usually when you know you need to hire someone. Don’t lose your business or family, and **don’t continue to beat your head against the wall over what needs to be done.&nbsp;**

You may want to hire someone new to the business, both so they can learn and you have some help. You can hire someone either full time or part time, and you can either hire someone locally or virtually. There are many qualified virtual assistants out there right now and companies who will do much of the training for you.

If you’d like to know where we’ve gotten our assistants, both locally and virtually, we’d be glad to share that with you. They come fairly well-trained, then we do specific team training with them. It’s not tough to find a qualified person, even if you need to find someone overseas as a virtual assistant. We’ve had great success with that.

You also might want to hire someone now so that they’re fully trained by springtime. **If you wait until March or April when you’re buried in work, it’s too late** because you’ll need some time to hire and train them. Remember that an assistant needs to help you make as much money as you’re paying them per month or double that to be worth hiring them.&nbsp;

We’re here to help you in any way we can. If you want to discuss this further or have any questions, just call or email us.&nbsp;
