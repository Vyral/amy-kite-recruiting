As an agent, you may believe that a seller’s ultimate goal is to make top dollar on their home sale. In reality, though, not all sellers are concerned with getting the most money possible. This is especially true with the incredibly low inventory levels we’re seeing in our market. Some sellers simply want to get cash in their hand so they can buy a home without contingencies, and they’re willing to sell at a discount.

**Remember, you’re here to serve your client**. You need to ask them questions about what they’re hoping to accomplish as a buyer or seller, and you can then shape your strategy to help them meet their goals. Additionally, do you have the resources to help them get what they need? For example, they may need a bridge loan, help from an investor, or a home equity line of credit in order to avoid a contingent sale. Can you help them through these processes?

**When speaking with your client, ask strong, open-ended questions about what the client needs**. Is money the most important thing for the client, or is their goal to have a quick sale? You can start at this base level and work your way further from there, which helps you develop a strategy to meet their goals. This approach is effective with buyers as well; by asking good questions, you’ll get a good idea of how you can meet your client’s goals.

If you have any questions about working with your clients or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to share the experience and knowledge I’ve gained throughout my years in real estate. Until then, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
