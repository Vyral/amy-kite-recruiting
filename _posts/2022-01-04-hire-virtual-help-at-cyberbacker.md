Today I’ll talk about virtual help and Cyberbacker. Cyberbacker of Illinois is a franchise of the Cyberbacker company based in Utah. They provide virtual assistants that are real estate trained and can help an agent with a number of different tasks. You could get someone to help you with transactions, lead follow-up, marketing, etc. Illinois actually requires a license for outbound calling, but not for follow-ups.&nbsp;

**I encourage you to consider a virtual assistant, especially with the job market being so tight.** My life changed when I started adding in people to help me. I was able to focus on what was important and allow others to handle the things that I wasn't the best at and that they could do better and faster. Paperwork is a pain, but it needs to be done so hire somebody who can help you. You’ll find your life will change when you hire the right person.

If you have any questions on how I leveraged Cyberbacker to help me, I’d love to have a conversation with you. I look forward to hearing from you.
