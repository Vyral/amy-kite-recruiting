Are you frustrated because your leads aren’t converting like they were a couple of months ago? Many agents in this situation are worried about what to do—they need the business to pay their bills, after all.&nbsp;

**Don’t lose sight of the fact that the leads you’re getting now will, on average, take about 13 months to convert.** After you put them in your database, be sure to nurture them by reaching out periodically so that they remember you by the time they’re ready to buy or sell. Even though they might not be ready today, work all your leads as though they were. If you cherish them and don’t give up, you’ll have plenty of business down the road.

If you have any questions about generating and converting leads, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to speak with you.
