Properties are no longer flying off the market quite as quickly as they used to over the past two years. Due to this downturn, I often get asked, “Should I stage my home?” The answer is a definite yes.

The market’s not what it was a few months ago when people were buying regardless of what the property looked like. Buyers now want properties that are in the best condition possible. **Paint and flooring are always the first two things you should revamp.** Anything after those two should only be minor upgrades to the bathroom and kitchen. Do everything you can to make your house look as awesome as possible.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
