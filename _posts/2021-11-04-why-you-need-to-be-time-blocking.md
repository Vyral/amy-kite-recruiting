How many of us let the day go by without achieving what we wanted to? Maybe there’s a task that really needs to get done, but it just never gets handled. Today I wanted to talk to you about time blocking. It’s one of the most important things in running a business, period.

**If you don’t time block, you’re giving your time away to whatever comes up.** Identify the three or four things that need to be done by the end of the day. Set aside time in your calendar to do those things and follow that.

I’ve gotten where I am because I’ve gotten up every morning and followed my calendar. You should do the same. **Fill your calendar first with the big rocks, the things you need to have done, and then write in the rest.** For example, you need to schedule a time to do prospecting.

If you don’t write it down, it’s not going to happen. Timeblock your calendar; it will change your world. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to give me a call. I’d love to hear from you.
