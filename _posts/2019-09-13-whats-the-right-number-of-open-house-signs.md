&nbsp;

How many signs should you use for your open house? In my opinion, you should have as many as possible.

**Open house signs are great for two reasons:**

1. They drive people to the property
2. They act as advertising for you.

I say you should have at least 10 signs—but 15 or 20 would be great. **Open houses generate more visibility from main roads, which results in more people driving by your property**.

If you have any other questions about this or any other topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
