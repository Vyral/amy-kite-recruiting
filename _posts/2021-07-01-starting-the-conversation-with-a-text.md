Are you texting your leads?

Think about yourself in this position: Do you prefer an email, text, or phone call? What’s the fastest way to communicate with people? I will tell you that **the vast majority of surveys say most people prefer texts**. They can answer it in the middle of a meeting or while doing something else. We’ve found that if you call, email, and text a lead that comes into your system, the text is the communication they respond to most.

Make sure you’re texting people, put yourself in their shoes, and think about what you’re texting them. Speaking for myself, as far as leads go, I can’t stand a text from an unnamed source that says, “Hey Amy, how ya doing?” I won’t respond to that. So, consider including the address they emailed you about in your text and say something like, “Hey, I’m reaching out to you about 123 Main St. Are you interested in seeing it?”

**Start the conversation and be succinct**. After you get a couple of responses, you can have deeper conversations. In the beginning, though, text quickly and make it short. I hope you’re able to convert more leads this way.

If you have questions about this topic or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
