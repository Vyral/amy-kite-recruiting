Someone called me the other day and asked whether I consider experienced agents for my team or if I’m only looking for new agents. The reality is that we look for both because each has great qualities.

**Just because you're experienced doesn't mean that a team can’t be a good fit for you.** If you're new to this business, you've got a lot to learn, and what better way to learn it than being surrounded by people who all work together as a team to teach you?

If you love a specific part of real estate and you don't like handling the other parts, **there are positions for you on teams**. If you’re struggling to do every aspect of the job, which is the case with a lot of people, consider joining a team. In our team’s case, we provide you with leads. Not all teams do this.

If you have any questions or if there's anything we can do to help you, please don’t hesitate to reach out to my team. We’d love to hear from you.
