You just got a new listing, so you do all the normal things. You put it on the MLS, post it on your Facebook page, and host an open house. Have you ever considered what else you can do to generate more business?

**You can host a neighborhood open house**. How often do you take a new listing, only for a new house down the road to go up for sale a month or two later? With a neighborhood open house, you can knock on doors, get to know the neighbors, ask them if they know someone who’s looking to sell, and possibly get more listings.

Also, ask your seller to post the video you made of their property on their social media. It might put you in touch with a few more people.

If there’s anything I can do to help you, please feel free to give me a call. I’d love to share some more tips with you.
