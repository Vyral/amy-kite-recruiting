As a real estate agent, you must have a routine to be successful. If you wake up in the morning and don't know what you're going to do, you're not going to be very productive.**&nbsp;**

**Instead, if you create a routine and stick to it every day, you will accomplish a lot.** It might start with meditation or exercise, but afterward, start making phone calls, doing follow-ups, generating leads, talking to the agent on the other side, scheduling showings, etc.

I had a time in my life when I felt like I wasn't accomplishing or doing anything. I created a checklist every day, so I could check things off and know I was completing things. If you find yourself in that situation, create a routine; it will help you generate money down the road.

If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
